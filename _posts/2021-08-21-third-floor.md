So, yesterday was my 30th birthday... and I've some thoughts about it.

I'm pretty sure you've had it too... This feeling when you're young and stupidly want to grow up as fast as possible so you can be "free". When you want to pass directly to this adulthood phase of your life where you'll be able to afford everything you want to buy and do everything you want to do and see eveything you want to see. When it feels like something is putting the breaks and you're not moving forward or, at least, as fast as you want. 

Just remembering puts a smile on my face 'cause I had this same feeling yesterday.

I think the difference between now and when I was younger is the fact that life now feels more immediate. Like everything's more attainable now even though everyting still takes time; and you can say that dealing with the unexpected has become a second instinct &ndash; or a necessary skill to surve &ndash;, when as a youngster things out of my control felt more unavoidable and disastrous. There's still so much I want to do, I want to buy and I want to see, but right now I feel like I'm in the drivers seat, pressing the breaks when finding curves in the road and accelerating at a pace I know I can take without crashing and dying.

Don't let anyone tell you that you have to have your life figured out by your twenties or whatever age they mention. You'll figure it out when you figure it out and suddenly everything will start making sense. Take it slow, and enjoy the ride. You only get one.
